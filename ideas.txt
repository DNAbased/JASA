quests: should be possible to add puzzles etc

skills: trick shot; attack with higher accuracy (once accuracy is implemented); double attack; first strike (once speed is implemented)

split into multiple scripts? starting to get messy

add a nemesis (final boss) also created in intro()?

add different planets? how to travel? how to implement planet check?

implement a different way of calculating experience gain

difficulty option?

save progress? should be sufficient to save the player character; might benefit from obscuring the contents of the (json?) save file

planets: put in json file

make encounterable enemies dependent on current planet
add option to count defeated enemies (as char class attribute?) --> might be used for quests

skills: separate function called from within battle

import function from python file in another folder?
