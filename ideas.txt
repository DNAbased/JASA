quests: should be possible to add puzzles etc

split into multiple scripts? starting to get messy

add a nemesis (final boss) also created in intro()? intro probably not possible; might also be difficult to implement with regard to the saving function; warrants further investigation

implement a different way of calculating experience gain
--> this also requires some in-depth analysis of how quickly level-ups should be possible
--> might be easier to adapt exp gain rather than fine tuning the required xp

difficulty option? (HP/dmg modifier for player) --> 
	0: Mundane: x5
	1: Easy: x2
	2: Vanilla: x1
	3: Challenging: x0.75
	4: Hard: x0.5
	5: Deranged: x0.2
	6: Impossible: x0.1

since the current HP increase will become insane pretty fast, need to find a better (probably more complicated) formula; also see exp gain

make encounterable enemies dependent on current planet
--> dict within dict? might be best to play around a bit
add option to count defeated enemies (as char class attribute?) --> might be used for quests

import function from python file in another folder?

second answer

need different/better/more interesting rewards for winning the enigmas

boosters probably should not fill up hp completely --> calculate?

rename 'rumours' to 'rumours and advice'? might be nice to implement some tips in there
