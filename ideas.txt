quests: should be possible to add puzzles etc

split into multiple scripts? starting to get messy

add a nemesis (final boss) also created in intro()? intro probably not possible; might also be difficult to implement with regard to the saving function; warrants further investigation

make encounterable enemies dependent on current planet
--> dict within dict? might be best to play around a bit
add option to count defeated enemies (as char class attribute?) --> might be used for quests

import function from python file in another folder?

second answer

need different/better/more interesting rewards for winning the enigmas

boosters probably should not fill up hp completely --> calculate?

rename 'rumours' to 'rumours and advice'? might be nice to implement some tips in there

enigmator: portal; monty python; 
more lateral thinking?

put difficulties in separate json file (thus requiring reworking of difficulty implementation in the script)
