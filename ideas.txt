quests: should be possible to add puzzles etc

skills: trick shot; attack with higher accuracy (once accuracy is implemented); double attack; first strike (once speed is implemented)

split into multiple scripts? starting to get messy

add a nemesis (final boss) also created in intro()?

implement a different way of calculating experience gain
--> this also requires some in-depth analysis of how quickly level-ups should be possible

difficulty option? (HP/dmg modifier for player) --> Mundane: x5; Easy: x2; Vanilly: x1; Hard: x0.75; Psychotic: x0.5; Deranged: x0.2; Impossible: x0.1

since the current HP increase will become insane pretty fast, need to find a better (probably more complicated) formula; also see exp gain

make encounterable enemies dependent on current planet
add option to count defeated enemies (as char class attribute?) --> might be used for quests

import function from python file in another folder?
